Thank you for your time.

As you know, we recently introduced CRO and experimentation to our system, and we want to showcase the significant impacts that can be achieved through the strategic implementation of VWO's solutions.


At MI, our goal is to effectively leverage VWO's key features to achieve exceptional results. To achieve this, we would require access to 100% sampling and custom segmentation features, all within the limited budget. Maintaining our budgetary constraints is a top priority, and we are keen on utilizing the same resources efficiently to achieve our desired outcomes.

I have had the privilege of working extensively with VWO in the past 5 years, both in my previous organizations and now at the MI. The positive experiences I have had in the past reinforce my confidence in VWO's potential to drive tangible outcomes for our ongoing projects at MI. I want to reiterate my commitment to establishing a long-term partnership with VWO.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss our mutual goals and the potential for a fruitful partnership.
